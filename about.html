<p>The SOIREE formed in response to a marked increase in the “glamourising through dramatising” present in many historical television dramas, historically based films and some historical re-enactment groups. </p>

<p>In recent years we have seen in the BBC’s <i>‘Robin Hood’</i> The Sherriff of Nottingham holding a poker competition 400 years before the game was even invented, we have seen a Henry VIII in <i>‘The Tudors’</i> looking more in need of a decent meal than a winch to get his 20 stone bulk on to a horse, and we have seen 20th Century Fox’s <i>‘Ice Age 3 (Dawn of the Dinosaurs)’</i>.</p>

<p>The SOIREE believes that any attempt to entertain at the expense of historical accuracy is not only deplorable, but wholly unnecessary. We strive to re-enact events from the lives of famous figures which are both historically accurate <i>and</i> realistic.</p>

<p>In addition to the ‘celebrities’ of history, The SOIREE also aims to champion, through historical re-enactment, events from the lives of those “ordinary” people not normally written about in the history books: The General Public; as equally deserving of historical recognition as kings, queens and armies.</p>
